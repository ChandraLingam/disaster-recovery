Hands-on Disaster Recovery on AWS Cloud

Hi and **Welcome** to the **Hands-on Disaster Recovery on AWS Cloud**

In this course, we are going to **deploy a multi-tier application** and **walk-through** various **disaster recovery options**, 
and **compare recovery time (RTO) and data loss (RPO)**

I am Chandra Lingam, and I am your instructor.

*Here is what you will learn in this course*

We start by discussing key concepts and terminologies.

"Everything Fails, All the Time" - Werner Vogles

You will learn about **Resiliency** and **Availability** (and, more importantly, what do they mean)

What differentiates **fault tolerance** and high availability

And why **high availability** alone is not disaster-proof

Once we understand the basics, we then jump into the labs

You will deploy a **multi-tier web application** [using DynamoDB Global Table, Lambda, API Gateway, EC2, Elastic Load Balancer, and Route 53]

And then explore **backup and restore** option

We will use **AWS Backup** and configure point-in-time-recovery (PITR), schedule backups, and maintain copies in a second region

We then simulate malicious **data loss** and corruption and how to **recover** the data

And how to handle the **loss of a region** using Backup and Restore

For the next lab, you will reconfigure the App in **Pilot Light** mode

And then observe how it helps minimize the data loss

We will then upgrade the infrastructure as **Warm Standby**

And how it helps reduce the recovery time

Finally, we look at the **multi-site active-active** configuration for a zero-downtime solution

You will also learn how DR changes with relational databases such as **RDS** and **Aurora**

We will configure point-in-time-recovery, schedule backup and continuous replication

With **Aurora Global Database**, you will perform both Managed Failover and Unplanned Failover to a DR Region

This is an intermediate level course and you need to have an AWS account with administrative access

You also need to be familiar with EC2, ELB, IAM, and Databases

I am looking forward to meeting you!

Happy Learning!
